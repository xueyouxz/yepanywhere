Topic: trusted-client-packaging

## Problem

Normal Remote Access can be zero-trust with respect to the relay only when the
entry client code is trusted. A hosted client such as `ya.graehl.org` is a
convenient bookmark/PWA entry point, but a compromise of that hosted JavaScript
can steal a password or cached resume secret before the SRP and encrypted relay
transport protections matter.

Trusted client packaging is the candidate answer for the stronger threat model:
the relay may be compromised, and the live hosted web origin may later be
compromised, but the user has already installed or pinned a trusted client.

## Candidate Shapes

- A packaged Android app serves bundled YA client assets from the app itself
  and only needs WebSocket connectivity to the configured relay.
- A Chrome-friendly local-client setup serves pinned client files from a stable
  local or extension origin rather than from a mutable hosted origin.
- A signed-update flow downloads replacement client assets only after verifying
  a manifest and artifact hashes under pinned graehl/kzahel signing keys.
- A first-run flow may still use full SRP with the Remote Access password, but
  later reconnects should prefer key-bound resume without asking the hosted page
  for the password again.

## Security Requirements

- A pinned value must be a verification key, key commitment, or server-auth
  proof input. It must not be a bearer token that an impostor server can simply
  accept.
- The client must authenticate the YA server, not merely the relay username.
  Full SRP already gives the client a server proof; session resume must also
  require an encrypted server proof bound to fresh client/server nonces before
  the client enters authenticated state.
- Cached resume material is secret bearer-equivalent material, not public-key
  material. Store it in the narrowest available app/origin scope and make it
  revocable from the YA server.
- The relay remains transport-only for authenticated Remote Access. It may see
  pairing metadata, timing, sizes, and public-share plaintext, but it must not
  receive Remote Access passwords or application plaintext.
- Public read-only shares remain a separate plaintext-to-relay design until YA
  grows share-specific end-to-end encryption.

## Current Remote Access Boundary

Protocol 3 resume uses a client nonce in `srp_resume_init`, the server's
one-time resume challenge as the transport nonce, and a `serverProof` encrypted
under the stored base session key. A relay-controlled impostor server can still
ask the client for a resume proof, but it cannot produce the server proof unless
it also has the stored resume key. The proof also carries the server's resume
protocol version; the client pins the highest authenticated protocol version it
has seen in local storage and rejects later resumes that prove a lower version.

That closes the compromised-relay false-server path after first trusted login.
It does not protect the password or cached resume key from malicious JavaScript
served by the trusted web origin itself. Avoiding that stronger hosted-client
threat requires signed or locally served client packaging.

## Open Questions

- Which install shape should be first: Android WebView assets, a Trusted Web
  Activity with signed asset pinning, a browser extension, or a local loopback
  static-file launcher?
- Should graehl and kzahel use independent signing keys, a threshold policy, or
  a primary/backup-key policy with explicit rotation?
- What is the minimum browser storage model that keeps local-file or
  extension-served YA ergonomic while preserving WebSocket, clipboard, and
  service-worker behavior?
- Should first full SRP also pin a server-auth public-key commitment, so future
  first-login-like flows can detect an impostor before revealing any password
  proof material?
