Topic: provider-read-edit-disciplines

## Two layers: native discipline vs YA presentation

There are two independent concerns, and the load-bearing fact is that YA only
owns the second:

1. **Native read/edit discipline** — how a provider's agent locates and rewrites
   file content: the tool names, the input schema, and the staleness/safety
   model. This is owned entirely by the provider's own agent (its system prompt,
   tool schema, and the model's training). YA does **not** define, override, or
   re-instruct the edit tools of any backend.
2. **YA presentation** — how a completed or in-flight read/edit *renders* in the
   session blocks-outline. YA canonicalizes every provider's named action blocks
   to one vocabulary and one diff view, so a phone supervisor sees the same
   `Edit` card whether the bytes came from Claude's `Edit`, Codex's
   `apply_patch`, pi's `edit`, or OpenCode's `edit`.

This separation is why adding a backend never means teaching a model a YA edit
format. The model emits whatever tool calls its own harness trained/prompted it
to emit; YA is strictly downstream for read/edit (it receives `tool_use` /
`tool_result`, normalizes, and renders). See *Initiation* below for why that is
also the right place to draw the line.

## The spectrum of native disciplines

Ordered by how much the format trusts the model's reproduction of file content
and where the "locating intelligence" lives (in verbatim text, in a context
anchor, or in line hashes). Claude/pi/OpenCode specifics below the Codex line
are exact-string-replacement variants that differ only in field names and
single-vs-array shape; Codex and hashline are the genuine outliers.

| Provider | Read | Edit | Locate / staleness |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `Read` returns `cat -n`-style line-prefixed text | `Edit` (verbatim `old_string`→`new_string`, unique-or-`replace_all`), `Write` for whole-file | exact byte match; line numbers are a display aid, not the address; enforced read-before-edit gate, stale file ⇒ match fails |
| Codex CLI | `read_file` / shell (`sed`/`cat`/`head`) | `apply_patch` emitting V4A grammar (`*** Begin Patch` / `*** Update File:` / `@@` context / `+`/`-`/space) | context-anchored, deliberately no line numbers; tolerant fuzzy/whitespace matching |
| OpenCode | `read` (`filePath`) | `edit` (`oldString`→`newString`, `replaceAll`), `write` | exact-string match (Claude-shaped under camelCase fields) |
| pi | `read` (`path`,`offset`,`limit`), no `cat -n` prefixes | `edit` (`edits[]` of `{oldText,newText}`, each matched against the *original*, non-overlapping, unique), `write` | exact-string match; LF-normalized + BOM-stripped before matching, line endings restored on write |
| Gemini / Grok (ACP) | provider tools over ACP | provider tools over ACP | provider-defined |

**Claude — verbatim string with a read-gate.** The `Read` line numbers are
inert; `Edit` locates by an exact `old_string` (raw bytes, whitespace included)
that must be unique or use `replace_all`. Read-before-edit is enforced, and a
file changed since the read is caught *indirectly* — the `old_string` no longer
matches — rather than by a dedicated integrity check.

**Codex — context-anchored V4A.** `apply_patch` emits a grammar that locates
hunks by surrounding context, not line numbers, and absorbs whitespace drift via
fuzzy matching. Per the peer research that motivated this doc (external,
uncited — treat as reported, not repo-verified): V4A is **trained into the GPT
weights**, not merely prompted, which is why it does not port cleanly — dropping
the V4A system-prompt instructions reportedly broke Azure-hosted GPT-4.1 (no
baked-in format), and Warp had to rename tools to match what Codex was trained on
(`grep`→`ripgrep`) and strip preambles that stalled the model. This is the
*anchor-in-weights* end of the spectrum.

**OpenCode and pi — exact-string, prompt/schema-anchored.** Both converge on the
same discipline as Claude's `Edit`: replace an exact substring. OpenCode's `edit`
is Claude's `Edit` with camelCase fields; pi's `edit` generalizes to an array of
disjoint `{oldText,newText}` replacements (each matched against the original
file, explicitly not incrementally). pi's tool is *prompt-anchored*, not
weights-anchored — it ships a `description`, `promptSnippet`, and
`promptGuidelines`, and a `prepareArguments` step that repairs known model
quirks (e.g. Opus 4.6 / GLM-5.1 sending `edits` as a JSON string instead of an
array). That repair layer is itself evidence the format is portable across a
model matrix rather than native to one.
(pi tools: `~/pi/packages/coding-agent/src/core/tools/{edit,read,write}.ts`.)

**hashline — a pi extension (external; a YA non-goal).** hashline is *not* a YA
mechanism and *not* a competitor harness; it is an alternative edit tool loaded
into pi via pi's tool-override extension API
(`~/pi/packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions/tool-override.ts` is the
mechanism, not hashline itself, which is not vendored in the `~/pi` fork). It
fuses a line number into the anchor and hashes the line content, making the
number load-bearing: a hash mismatch is a *first-class rejection of the whole
edit set before touching the file* — the most conservative point on the
staleness spectrum, versus Claude's indirect match-failure and Codex's fuzzy
absorption. The implementation worth knowing is jerryan's `hashline-edit` fork,
which hex-encodes the short hashes. **YA does not employ hashline in any
YA-specific way and has no plan to.** It is recorded here only as the
conservative reference point for the spectrum.

## How YA maps named blocks to one presentation

YA canonicalizes to **Claude's tool vocabulary** (`Read`, `Edit`, `Write`,
`Bash`, `Grep`, `Glob`, …) and Claude-style input field names (`file_path`,
`old_string`, `new_string`). The mapping happens in layers, each near the data
it normalizes (per the render-boundary principle), so live streaming and
reloaded history agree:

- **Client name aliases** —
  `packages/client/src/components/renderers/tools/index.tsx` `TOOL_NAME_ALIASES`
  (e.g. `apply_patch`→`Edit`, `shell_command`/`exec_command`→`Bash`,
  case-insensitive) feed the `ToolRendererRegistry`; unknown names fall through
  to the raw-JSON fallback renderer rather than a misleading alias.
- **Codex server normalization** —
  `packages/server/src/codex/normalization.ts` does more than rename: Codex
  performs reads/writes/greps as **shell commands**, so
  `normalizeCodexToolInvocation` reverse-maps a `bash` call into a canonical
  block — `sed`/`cat`/`head` ⇒ `Read`, `rg` ⇒ `Grep`, heredoc write ⇒ `Write` —
  and `apply_patch` ⇒ `Edit`. Output is re-shaped to match
  (`normalizeReadOutput`, `normalizeRipgrepOutput`, etc.).
- **pi server map** — `packages/server/src/sdk/providers/pi-tools.ts`
  `normalizePiTool` maps names (`read`→`Read`, `edit`→`Edit`, …) **and** fields
  (pi `path`→`file_path` for Read/Write/Edit; a single-element pi `edits[]` is
  expanded to `old_string`/`new_string` so the diff augment engages; `grep`
  keeps `path` since Claude's Grep also uses `path`).
  `normalizePiToolResult` maps pi text results into YA's structured `Bash`,
  `Read`, `Write`, and `Edit` result contracts where safe, and pi edit
  `details.patch` is preserved as a raw patch so multi-edit rows can render a
  diff after reload. Non-vanilla pi sessions that emit an `apply_patch` tool
  also map to canonical `Edit` with the same raw-patch interpretation Codex
  uses; vanilla pi is unaffected because it does not emit that tool.
- **Gemini-CLI server map** — `packages/server/src/sdk/providers/gemini-tools.ts`
  `normalizeGeminiTool` maps the non-ACP `gemini` CLI's `read_file`→`Read`,
  `replace`→`Edit` (`old_content`/`new_content`→`old_string`/`new_string`),
  `write_file`→`Write`, `glob`→`Glob`, `search_file_content`→`Grep`,
  `run_shell_command`→`Bash`. Used by both `gemini.ts` (live) and
  `normalization.ts` `convertGeminiMessages` (durable). `write_todos` /
  `delegate_to_agent` / `save_memory` stay unmapped (honest raw fallback — their
  field shapes don't match a canonical renderer). The ACP gemini/grok path
  instead canonicalizes via `toolCall.kind`→`mapKindToToolName`.
- **OpenCode server map** —
  `packages/server/src/sdk/providers/opencode-tools.ts`
  `OPENCODE_TOOL_NAME_MAP` plus `OPENCODE_TOOL_FIELD_RENAMES` (e.g. `edit`:
  `oldString`→`old_string`, `newString`→`new_string`, `replaceAll`→`replace_all`)
  — the complete name+field shape that pi still defers. Shared by the live
  provider and the durable reader so both render identically.

### The uniform diff augment

Renaming gets a block to the right renderer; the **diff augment** gives every
`Edit`, whatever its source format, one diff view.
`packages/server/src/augments/edit-augments.ts` `computeEditAugment` turns an
(`old_string`,`new_string`) pair into a `structuredPatch` (jsdiff) plus
syntax-highlighted, word-level `diffHtml`. It is attached to the `Edit`
`tool_use` input live by `stream-augmenter.ts` and on reload by
`sessions/persisted-augments.ts`, so the renderer needs no provider knowledge.
`EditRenderer.tsx` consumes `_structuredPatch` / `_diffHtml`, and for Codex
falls back to a `_rawPatch` (`RawPatchPreview`) parsed from the V4A text via
`computeStructuredPatchDiffHtml` when no old/new pair exists. Result: the same
collapsed preview, expand-to-modal, "show full context", and copy-post-change
affordances regardless of backend.

## Initiation — where the edit format comes from

The user's original framing is correct: a model emits read/edit actions in its
**native format unless nudged otherwise by tool instructions**. In YA's
architecture that nudging happens entirely inside each provider's own agent —
the Claude Agent SDK defines `Edit`/`Write`/`Read`; `codex` owns `apply_patch`;
`pi --mode rpc` owns its `edit`/`read`/`write`; OpenCode owns its tools. YA
supplies task content and reads back blocks. **YA never injects an edit-format
instruction**, which means the initiation axis is purely a provider property:

- *Anchor-in-weights* (Codex V4A): the trained model produces the format; high
  edit fidelity on its native model, but degrades/breaks when the format is
  moved off that model (the reported Azure/Warp cases).
- *Anchor-in-prompt/schema* (Claude `Edit`, pi/OpenCode `edit`): the format is
  carried by the tool schema + guidelines and can be driven into many models;
  exact-string replacement is simple enough to be effectively in-distribution
  for essentially every instruction-tuned model, which is why provider-agnostic
  harnesses (pi, OpenCode) standardize on it instead of a trained grammar.

### Design principle: don't impose off-distribution edit formats

Recorded as a project design stance (user, 2026-06-22), and one I agree with
directionally with a sharpening:

> Telling a model to edit in a way it was not weights-trained to do is an unwise
> source of friction — except for batch "write the program that performs this
> mass transformation" cases.

**Verdict.** Agreed for *high-ceremony structured* formats (V4A grammar,
hashline hashes): the empirical evidence (above) is that forcing them
off-distribution lowers fidelity or breaks. The sharpening: the robust dividing
line is the **locating burden the format places on the model**, not literally
"present in the training set." Exact-string replacement is prompt-anchored yet
near-universal, so "edit in your weights-native way" and "use a simple universal
exact-string format" mostly coincide in practice — they diverge only for formats
that demand the model reproduce/track structure it has no prior for (V4A is
native to GPT; hashline is native to nothing until trained). The batch-transform
exception is really a *different mechanism* (emit a codemod/program, not a
per-edit anchor format), so it does not weaken the rule for interactive edits.

**Consequence for YA.** This is the design rationale for the two-layer split:
YA's correct posture is to **map presentation, not dictate format**. YA should
not add a YA edit tool or rewrite a backend's edit discipline; it should keep
canonicalizing whatever native blocks arrive. A non-native format is worth its
friction only when it buys a safety property the native one lacks (hashline's
hard staleness rejection vs Claude's indirect match-failure) — a trade YA is not
currently making.

## Audit 2026-06-22 — fixtures vs normalization code

Checked each provider's example transcripts (`packages/server/test/fixtures/`)
against the normalization code. Findings and resolutions:

- **Closed — Gemini CLI (`gemini.ts`)** was emitting raw `tool_name`
  (`read_file`/`replace`/`write_file`/`glob`/`search_file_content`/
  `run_shell_command`), which hit the raw-JSON fallback (no rich card, no diff
  augment). Added `gemini-tools.ts` (`normalizeGeminiTool`), wired into the live
  and durable paths, with `gemini-tools.test.ts`.
- **Closed — pi argument fields and durable reload parity.** `pi-tools.ts`
  (`normalizePiTool` / `normalizePiToolResult`) now renames fields in addition
  to names and structures pi built-in results for the renderer, with
  `pi-tools.test.ts` and `pi-reader.test.ts`. The live `PiProvider` path and
  durable `PiSessionReader` path both use the same canonical mapping, so pi
  sessions reloaded after a YA restart should keep the original action-card
  headline/detail quality.
- **Verified OK — ACP (gemini-acp, grok).** Canonicalize via
  `toolCall.kind`→`mapKindToToolName`; no gap.
- **Verified OK — Codex / OpenCode.** Codex reverse-maps shell + `apply_patch`;
  OpenCode has the name+field map with tests.

## Open follow-ups

- **Unknown-tool honesty** — keep the "no misleading alias for unknown tools"
  rule (OpenCode/Gemini/pi normalizers all pass unmapped tools through; see
  `opencode-backend.md` *Gaps To Close*).
- **pi multi-edit** — a multi-element pi `edits[]` renders by name only (no
  MultiEdit renderer); revisit if multi-edit pi turns become common.
- **Gemini todo/subagent rendering** — `write_todos`/`delegate_to_agent` are
  intentionally unmapped; map them (with field remaps) if Gemini-CLI todo/Task
  rendering becomes worth it.
