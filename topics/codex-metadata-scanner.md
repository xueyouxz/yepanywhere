# Codex Metadata Scanner

Implementation plan:
[`docs/tactical/019-codex-metadata-scanner-index.md`](../docs/tactical/019-codex-metadata-scanner-index.md).

## Why It Exists

Codex stores local rollouts by time, not by project:

```text
~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-....jsonl
```

YA's project and session lists are project-oriented. To build those lists,
the server must learn each rollout's cwd from `session_meta`. The metadata
scanner exists to bridge that mismatch without spawning a Codex runtime.

The important invariant: `session_meta` is head metadata. After the first
successful parse for a rollout, its id/cwd/timestamp should be treated as
stable unless there is evidence the file was replaced or corrupted. Ordinary
append activity should not force repeated metadata reads.

## Current Implementation Shape

Current Codex discovery uses layered caches plus a provider-neutral discovery
index:

- `CodexSessionScanner` recursively finds rollout files, reads first-line
  `session_meta`, groups by cwd, and caches the result for 5 seconds.
- `CodexSessionReader` has a shared 5-second scan cache keyed by sessions
  directory and active-window scope. Reader scans now record cache status,
  duration, directories walked, rollout counts, plain/zstd precedence
  filtering, discovery-index behavior, first-line reads by representation,
  skipped metadata files, and subagent sessions filtered from ordinary lists.
- `.jsonl.zst` support is a runtime capability. YA still declares Node
  `>=20`; Node 20 does not expose native `node:zlib` zstd APIs, so compressed
  rollouts are skipped cleanly and counted as unsupported on those runtimes.
- `SessionDiscoveryIndex` persists normalized provider head metadata under
  `{dataDir}/indexes/session-discovery/<provider>/<source-root-hash>/...`.
  Codex uses date-bucket shards such as `2026/06/25.json` and stores a small
  source fingerprint to distinguish ordinary append growth from common
  same-path replacement cases.
- `CodexSessionScanner` records per-scan metrics for duration, directories
  walked, rollout counts, plain/zstd precedence filtering, discovery-index
  hits/misses/suspect records, first-line reads by representation, and
  cache-backed compressed discovery. Normal scans log these metrics at debug;
  slow scans warn.
- `ProjectScanner` keeps a short-lived project snapshot and coalesces
  concurrent scans.
- `SessionIndexService` persists normalized session summaries and avoids
  reparsing unchanged sessions, but full validation still enumerates files
  through the reader and stats discovered paths.
- `FileWatcher` marks Codex scopes dirty when rollout files change; because a
  raw file event does not identify the owning project scope cheaply, loaded
  Codex scopes are marked dirty broadly. Full-tree rescans now record duration,
  files scanned, emitted create/modify/delete counts, and overlap skips.

These layers are useful for normal navigation and request bursts. The discovery
index now avoids rereading `session_meta` for observed known rollouts, including
ordinary append/mtime/size changes. It does not change the underlying
enumeration cost: discovering an uncached or invalidated Codex tree still walks
provider-owned rollout files.

Cached Codex metadata is treated as suspect and reread when the file identity
changes for the same representation, when a plain file shrinks below the
cached observation, or when compressed size changes for an indexed compressed
rollout. A same-path overwrite that preserves file identity and non-shrinking
size remains a known gap because stat metadata alone cannot prove line 1
changed.

The discovery index is derived and non-authoritative. YA must enumerate
provider files first and then consult the cache only for those observed files.
A missing provider file is hidden immediately even if its discovery record
still exists on disk.

## Compression Gate

Codex may compress older rollouts to `.jsonl.zst`. YA should support those
files eventually, but compressed discovery has a stricter performance bar than
plain JSONL.

Plain `.jsonl` first-line reads can use a partial file read and stop once a
newline is found. A naive `.jsonl.zst` implementation that reads and
decompresses the whole file just to find the first line is not acceptable for
default scanner paths.

Default `.jsonl.zst` discovery is gated on native runtime zstd support plus at
least one of:

- a durable metadata cache hit from the earlier plain `.jsonl`
  representation;
- a streaming zstd first-line reader that stops after decoding the first JSONL
  record;
- an explicit opt-in slow path for users who accept whole-file decompression
  during discovery.

As of 2026-06-25, YA satisfies this gate with a streaming zstd first-line
reader in `readFirstLine()` when Node exposes native zstd APIs. On runtimes
without native zstd, YA skips `.jsonl.zst` rollouts rather than crashing or
falling back to whole-file decompression. Keep that separation intact: full
compressed session detail loads may read the full transcript on supported
runtimes, but scanner metadata discovery must not depend on whole-file zstd
decompression.

## Watcher And Scheduling Gaps

There is not yet a date-bucket-aware Codex scanner scheduler.

The server creates a `FileWatcher` for the Codex sessions directory. On
Windows and macOS, the Codex watcher currently enables a periodic full-tree
rescan by default because recursive `fs.watch` can miss deep file writes.
`CODEX_WATCH_PERIODIC_RESCAN_MS` is the minimum interval: periodic rescans use
self-scheduled timeouts, never overlap, back off when scans are slow or overlap
with another rescan, and recover toward the configured minimum after cheap
scans.

Known gaps:

- no scan budget or time slicing;
- no date-bucket high-water mark for routine active-list discovery;
- no per-scope dirty precision for Codex project lists;
- no high-water-mark scheduler using discovery shards to scan recent date
  buckets more often than cold buckets.

This is acceptable only under YA's current single-user/small-team assumption.
It is not a design for millions of rollout files.

## Performance Failure Modes

The main costs are filesystem and metadata costs, not full transcript parsing:

- recursive `readdir` over the sessions tree;
- `stat` calls during validation and watcher rescans;
- first-line reads for new, suspect, or unindexed rollouts;
- replacement validation gaps for same-path files whose first line changes
  without changing source identity or shrinking below the cached observation;
- full decompression if compressed files are read without streaming
  first-line support;
- compressed sessions being hidden on Node runtimes without native zstd
  support;
- route fan-out that asks for global, project, inbox, and provider-catalog
  views close together.

Turning `SESSION_AUTO_ARCHIVE_DAYS` off makes default lists complete, which is
the correct user-visible default, but it also removes the old active-window
shortcut that skipped old Codex files during default scans. Completeness and
scanner cost need to be reconciled through better indexing, not hidden
session filtering.

## Required Near-Term Fixes

Before broadening Codex history discovery further, especially around compressed
transitions and very large trees, the scanner should gain:

1. An explicit validation strategy for same-identity, non-shrinking header
   overwrites; current source-fingerprint and shrink checks cover common
   replacement/truncation cases without rereading ordinary appends.
2. Add dirty-scope metrics so broad Codex invalidation is visible before
   changing the dirty-marking strategy.
3. Keep streaming zstd first-line reads covered by tests so scanner discovery
   does not regress to full compressed transcript decompression.
4. Date-bucket/high-water metrics once routine scans stop walking the whole
   tree.
5. Date-bucket or high-water missed-event recovery that avoids full-tree
   probing for routine cold history.

## Non-Goals

- Do not spawn Codex just to list local sessions.
- Do not forge or rewrite rollout files to make scanning easier.
- Do not hide old sessions by default as a substitute for a bounded scanner.
- Do not make `.jsonl.zst` default discovery depend on whole-file
  decompression.
- Do not silently replace YA-visible session ids with provider-native ids while
  refactoring the scanner.
